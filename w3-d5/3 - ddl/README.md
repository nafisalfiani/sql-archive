# ddl

Once the ERD is ready, create SQL queries to achieve the following:

Create tables as per the ERD with necessary constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, and check constraints (for enforcing the maximum number of books a member can borrow).

- Insert sample data into the tables.

Answer this questions:

- Query 1: List the titles of books borrowed by a member (identified by a specific Member_ID).
- Query 2: Find out the members who have borrowed books but have not returned yet.
- Query 3: Find out the total number of books borrowed by a member (identified by a specific Member_ID).
- Query 4: List the books which were not returned in good condition.
- Query 5: Identify members who have borrowed more than one book at a time.

Submissions of Step 3: SQL Queries

- Create a new file named setup.sql.
- Write SQL queries to create tables according to the ERD you created in step 2.
- Write SQL queries to insert sample data into the tables.
