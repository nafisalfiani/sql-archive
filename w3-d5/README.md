# Library SQL

Scenario:

You are to create a database for a small library system which manages its books and members. The library lends books to members. Here are the initial requirements:

- Books have attributes: ISBN, title, author, publisher, and year of publication.
- Members have attributes: member ID, first name, last name, date of birth, and address.
- A lending transaction should record the date of lending, date of return, and the condition of the book at the time of return.
- Each book can only be lent to one member at a time.
- Members can borrow multiple books at once, but not more than 5 at a time.
